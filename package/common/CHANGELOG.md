# veysur-common

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- aa9a88e: Embed a published survey in another website. The Share tab has an embed card with a copyable script tag and an on/off switch (`access.embed`). The allowed websites (`access.embedDomains`) are set in the Access Control settings, as a project default and per survey, and apply on publish. Publishing writes static, cacheable files (an immutable per-language file per snapshot and a short-lived pointer), so a passive page view makes no API or database call; the participant is authenticated only on their first answer. Only open surveys without public registration or file-upload questions can be embedded. A repair task (`surveyEmbedArtefact.repairAll`) rewrites missing files for surveys published before this release.
- af4bb1a: Add an optional private per-user `maxClients` setting that overrides the default limit of five signed-in clients, clamped between 1 and 100. Add `ServiceImportExport.importFromStream` for importing an archive already in memory, used by seeds and fixtures. It is not exposed through an endpoint.

### Patch Changes

- 6172377: Stop reserving `demo` as a project subdomain, so a deployment can use it for its own demo project.
